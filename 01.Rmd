## Why listen to your heart?

According to the CDC, the leading cause of death for Americans is heart disease. I lost a friend recently to heart disease. I cannot testify to my friendâ€™s cardiovascular fitness before his untimely passing, but I am told level of fitness is a predictor for cardiovascular mortality. Understanding patterns in heart rhythms can optimize exercise performance and provide disease detection.

## How do I listen to my heart?

Heart-rate data can be collected using wearable devices such as smart watches and chest strap heart-rate monitors. Heart-rate patterns are an indicator of a variety of medical and non-medical conditions. For example, the pattern of a deconditioned heart during exercise appears distinct to the pattern illustrated by a heart that is trained by routine exercise. A deeper look at the changes of heart-rate during exercise can inform, for instance, whether shortness of breath from intense training is a sign of a deconditioned heart or an early indicator of heart disease.

MyHeartHealthApp is a software service and app to apply machine learning to heart-rate data. Our team develops insights and predictive capability to improve health and cardiovascular fitness. Based on age, weight, and exercise history, a smart watch app will provide the user with visual and haptic feedback to encourage the user to adjust the level of their workout intensity. If a user shows signs of overexertion, for example, the app will prompt the user to reduce their pace. A user will be able to target heart rate zones to achieve specific health goals such as weight loss. 

## A service for the heart

We expect analysis of population heart-rate data will give insight into the cardiovascular fitness of those ranging from the daily walker to the weekend warrior. We further propose that machine learning algorithms can help improve heart disease outcomes.
