## The Art of Wargames

Simulation is a medium for modeling systems or processes independent of real-world environments. In the military context, wargame simulation is a commonly applied tool - the insights that come from testing in virtual environments is used for the development of military tactics, system design, and analysis. To that end, military research laboratories and private contractors conduct computer-based wargame simulation exercises on a large scale. In these virtual wargame exercises, hundreds of people sit at computing terminals controlling geographically distributed entities as varied as an individual soldier, a battalion composed of troops, or tools of war such as tanks and fighter jets.

The lead-up to these massive wargame exercises, often referred to as the scenario build, is its own symphony of complex research and information gathering. During scenario build, a common “ground truth” data set is compiled of, among other things, operating characteristics of the hundreds of thousands of digital entities that are to be employed in the exercise. Operating characteristics include, for example, the top speed of a B-2 Stealth Bomber or the number of rounds available on the main gun of an M1 Abrams tank. Scenario build often takes weeks to months to complete. These text documents need to be specifically formatted to be read into the various simulation applications. 

Importantly, the time spent identifying operating characteristics pulls analysts away from more valuable work. Highly classified data, such as radar signatures for top secret warplanes, adds additional challenges to the scenario build process. Not only must an analyst have an appreciation of complex physics of radio waves, but she must also have clearance and training for handling restricted information.

In sum, repeatedly collecting the large amounts of public data that drives these simulations takes significant time and effort, which should be spent handling more sensitive information. Using data science to algorithmically collect and process this input data would reduce the preparation time for war game simulations, freeing up analyst time for more valuable work.

## Behind the Curtain

We aim to build an algorithm to scrape and parse Wikipedia for operating characteristics of military systems and generate a massive database that represents the hierarchical structure of all the world’s fighting forces. We will make the database publically available on the internet via an Application Programming Interface (API).

Suppose, for instance, that an analyst seeks to build a scenario that models the likely sequence of events following a North Korean missile launch towards a U.S. base in Guam. The notional operational range for a variety of anti-ballistic missiles is provided in the specification section of Wikipedia pages and can be found manually with search and deep reading. Alternatively, the specifications could be easily imported directly into the simulation and visualized on a map with rings that represent range using our WargamesAPI connection. Another example is if a university instructor seeks to develop a map-based narrative recreating the reconnaissance missions flown by U.S. airmen during the Cuban Missile Crisis. The cruise speed and maximum altitude for a U-2 spy plane can be read directly into the modeling or visualization environment that will represent the historical context. Users will link to the WargamesAPI to extract data relevant to any historical or hypothetical military scenario, shifting the analytical focus from management of technical details to illustration of important storylines and testing of mission critical concepts.

## A Better Way

Machine learning and natural language processing have lowered the barriers to mining structured and unstructured text data for the nuggets of information that are most useful. Using data science, we can simplify the collection of publically accessible data to free analyst time to focus on the more complex data.
