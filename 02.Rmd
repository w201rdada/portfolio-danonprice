## The Art of Wargames

Wargame simulation is a commonly applied tool for military system design and analysis. Military research laboratories and private contractors conduct wargame simulation exercises on large scale. Multiple times a year, dozens of simulation applications on hundreds of computers are networked linked between several geographically located analytic centers to test system performance and battle tactics. In virtual wargame exercises, hundreds of people sit at computing terminals controlling geographically distributed entities as varied as an individual soldier to battalions composed of troops and tools of war such as tanks and fighter jets. 

## Behind the Curtain

The lead up to these massive wargame exercises, often referred to as scenario build, is its own symphony of complex research and information gathering. During scenario build, a common “ground truth” data set is compiled of, among other things, operating characteristics of the hundreds of thousands of digital entities that are to be employed in the exercise. Operating characteristics include, for example, attributes such as the top speed of a B-2 Stealth Bomber or the number of rounds available on the main gun of an M1 Abrams tank. Scenario build often takes on the order of weeks to months to complete. A hidden truth of scenario build is that analysts often “fat finger” operating characteristics into text documents that are cribbed from Jane’s Aerospace, Defense and Security manuals or, more likely, Wikipedia. These text documents are specifically formatted to be read into the various simulation applications. 

## A Better Way

Machine learning and natural language processing have lowered the barriers to mining structured and unstructured text data for the nuggets of information that are most useful. I would like to build an algorithm to parse Wikipedia for operating characteristics of military systems to generate a massive database that represents the structure of all the world’s fighting forces. I would like to make the database publically available on the internet via an Application Programming Interface (API). Suppose, for instance, that an analyst seeks to build a scenario that models the sequence of events that are a likely response to North Korea launching a missile towards a U.S. base in Guam. Or perhaps, if a university instructor seeks to develop a scenario that recreates the reconnaissance missions that were flown by U.S. airmen during the Cuban Missile Crisis. Users could link to the API to extract
