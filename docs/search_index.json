["Heart-Rhythm.html", "1 Listen to Your Heart 1.1 Why listen to your heart? 1.2 How do I listen to my heart? 1.3 Service for the heart 1.4 References", " 1 Listen to Your Heart Keywords heart-rate, heart disease, machine learning, cardiovascular, exercise, wearable devices 1.1 Why listen to your heart? According to the CDC, the leading cause of death for an American is heart disease.1 I lost a friend recently to heart disease. I cannot testify to my friend’s cardiovascular fitness before his untimely passing but level of fitness is a predictor for cardiovascular mortality.2 Understanding patterns in heart rhythms can optimize exercise performance and provide disease detection. 1.2 How do I listen to my heart? Heart-rate data can be collected using wearable devices such as smart watches, armband heart-rate monitors, and chest strap heart-rate monitors. Heart-rate patterns are an indicator of a variety of medical and non-medical conditions. For example, the pattern of a deconditioned heart during exercise appears distinct to the pattern illustrated by a heart that is trained by routine exercise. A deeper look at the changes of heart-rate during exercise can gives us clues to inform, for instance, whether shortness of breath from intense training is a sign of a deconditioned heart or an early indicator of heart disease. 1.3 Service for the heart We will build a software service and app to apply statistical analysis and machine learning to heart-rate data. We will develop insights and predictive capability to improve health and cardiovascular fitness. Users will initiate exercise heart-rate tracking using our smart watch app or smart phone app paired with a bluetooth heart-rate monitor. Based on age, weight, and exercise history, the app will provide the user with visual, aural, and haptic feedback to encourage the user to adjust level of workout intensity. For example, if a user shows signs of overexertion, the app will prompt the user to reduce the pace. Similarly, if a user is underperforming relative to previously tracked data, the user will be encouraged to increase exercise intensity. A user will be able to target heart rate zones to achieve specific health goals such as weight loss, muscle build, or cardiovascular conditioning. After an exercise session, a summary report will be provided to the user. We will provide the user with the opportunity to share summary data with health care providers. We expect analysis of population heart-rate data will give insight into the cardiovascular fitness of those ranging from the daily walker to the weekend warrior. We will encourage users to share anonymized data that we will aggregate for population study and sharing with researchers. 1.4 References https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/fastats/leading-causes-of-death.htm↩ Sachin Gupta, Anand Rohatgi, Colby R.

["WargamesAPI.html", "2 Wargames Database 2.1 The Art of Wargames 2.2 Behind the Curtain 2.3 A Better Way", " 2 Wargames Database Keywords wargame, simulation, api, natural language processing, machine learning 2.1 The Art of Wargames Simulation is a medium for modeling systems or processes independent of real world environments. Wargame simulation is a commonly applied tool for development of military tactic, system design, and analysis. Military research laboratories and private contractors conduct computer-based wargame simulation exercises on large scale. Multiple times a year, dozens of simulation applications on hundreds of computers are networked linked between several geographically located analytic centers to test system performance and battle tactics long before metal is bent and rivets drilled on new weapon systems. In virtual wargame exercises, hundreds of people sit at computing terminals controlling geographically distributed entities as varied as an individual soldier to battalions composed of troops and tools of war such as tanks and fighter jets. The insights learned from testing ideas in virtual environments are the reward of wargame simulation. Behind the scenes, the risk associated with lead time required to collect the large amounts of data that drive the simulation presents opportunities for improvement. 2.2 Behind the Curtain The lead up to these massive wargame exercises, often referred to as scenario build, is its own symphony of complex research and information gathering. During scenario build, a common “ground truth” data set is compiled of, among other things, operating characteristics of the hundreds of thousands of digital entities that are to be employed in the exercise. Operating characteristics include, for example, attributes such as the top speed of a B-2 Stealth Bomber or the number of rounds available on the main gun of an M1 Abrams tank. Scenario build often takes on the order of weeks to months to complete. A hidden truth of scenario build is that analysts often “fat finger” operating characteristics into text documents that are cribbed from Jane’s Aerospace, Defense and Security manuals or, more likely, Wikipedia. These text documents are specifically formatted to be read into various simulation applications. Operating characteristics are only a slice of a bigger pie when it comes to the input data for a wargame exercise. Highly classified data such as radar signatures for top secret warplanes adds additional challenge to the scenario build process. Not only does an analyst have to have an appreciation of complex physics of radio waves but she must also have clearance and training for handling restricted information. Operating characteristics, on the other hand, are generally publically available high-level specification data that is easily gleaned from marketing material but crucial to modeling, for instance, the size of an object in 3-dimensional space. Why not simplify collection of publically accessible data to free analyst time to focus on the more complex data? Machine learning and natural language processing have lowered the barriers to mining structured and unstructured text data for the nuggets of information that are most useful. 2.3 A Better Way We aim to build an algorithm to scrap and parse Wikipedia for operating characteristics of military systems to generate a massive database that represents the hierarchical structure of all the world’s fighting forces. We will make the database publically available on the internet via an Application Programming Interface (API). Suppose, for instance, that an analyst seeks to build a scenario that models the sequence of events that are a likely response to North Korea launching a missile towards a U.S. base in Guam. The notional operational range for a variety of anti-ballistic missiles is provided in the specification section of Wikipedia pages with search and deep reading. Alternatively, the specifications could be easily imported directly into simulation and visualized on a map with rings that represent range using our WargamesAPI connection. Or perhaps, if a university instructor seeks to develop a map-based narrative recreating the reconnaissance missions flown by U.S. airmen during the Cuban Missile Crisis. The cruise speed and maximum altitude for a U-2 spy plane can be read directly into the modeling or visualization environment that will represent the historical context. Users will link to the WargamesAPI to extract data relevant to any historical or hypothetical military scenario shifting the analytical focus from management of technical details to illustration of important storylines and testing of mission critical concepts.
